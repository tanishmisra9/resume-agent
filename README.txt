Project: Resume Agent

Goal: Build an AI agent that:
	•	Takes in a user’s resume (PDF or text)
	•	Fetches a job posting via an API (or user-pasted link)
	•	Tailors the resume to fit the job description — rewriting bullet points and highlighting relevant skills
	•	Outputs a new PDF or markdown file for download
Stack (recommended):
	•	Python + Streamlit (or Gradio) for UI
	•	OpenAI API (GPT-4 or GPT-4o) for analysis & rewriting
	•	LangChain (optional) for document parsing / workflow orchestration
	•	PyPDF2 / pdfplumber for parsing resumes
	•	Requests / BeautifulSoup for job scraping (if no official API)
	•	FPDF or reportlab for PDF export

Week 1 – Build the Core Agent

Day 1: Ideation & Setup
Define final goal and feature set.
Initialize GitHub repo (resume-agent).
Set up Python environment + .env for API keys.
Document initial plan in README.md.

Day 2: Resume Input Pipeline
Use PyPDF2 or pdfplumber to extract text from resume PDFs.
Test text parsing (ensure formatting is preserved reasonably).
Save parsed text to a temporary .txt file.

Day 3: Job Posting Ingestion
Accept either a pasted link or raw job description text.
Implement web scraping (requests + BeautifulSoup) for basic job data (title, description, skills).
Store this data in a structured JSON format.

Day 4: Matching Engine (Core LLM Logic)
Write a prompt template for GPT that:
Takes the resume + job description
Returns a rewritten version emphasizing matching skills
Test in console (no UI yet).
Save LLM responses to text for evaluation.

Day 5: Resume Tailoring Algorithm
Add logic to keep structure (sections like Experience, Projects).
Implement extraction + re-injection of bullet points (use regex or simple section parsing).
Ensure the rewritten version keeps consistent tone and formatting.

Day 6: Output Formatting
Generate clean Markdown or text output from GPT response.
Optionally, use FPDF or python-docx to produce a downloadable version.

Day 7: Review & Refactor
Review code structure: separate modules (parser, fetcher, agent, formatter).
Add docstrings + logging.
Commit progress with clear documentation.

Week 2 – Build the Frontend + Polish

Day 8: Streamlit UI Setup
Build a simple Streamlit app:
File uploader for resume
Text box or link input for job posting
Button to “Tailor Resume”
Display tailored result on screen.

Day 9: Integrate Backend
Hook up backend agent logic to UI.
Handle loading states, errors, and formatting nicely.
Test full end-to-end flow.

Day 10: Fine-tuning & Evaluation
Experiment with different prompt styles to improve accuracy and structure.
Add temperature, tone, and style options (e.g., “concise,” “impact-driven,” “creative”).

Day 11: Export Options
Add download button for tailored resume (PDF or DOCX).
Clean formatting before export (consistent bullet style, spacing).

Day 12: Testing & Feedback
Try different resumes and job links.
Fix edge cases:
Non-English job postings
Missing sections in resumes
Formatting errors

Day 13: Documentation & Demo
Polish README.md:
What it does
How to run it
Example screenshots
Add a short Loom or GIF demo if possible.

Day 14: Final Touches & Deployment
Push repo public on GitHub.
(Optional) Deploy Streamlit app online via Streamlit Cloud.
Share link on your portfolio / LinkedIn.
